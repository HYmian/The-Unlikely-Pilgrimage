Then in your `config.toml`, edit `theme = "dream"` and save.

## Let's configure this theme!

***I assume you have already viewd [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), if you want to use this theme, the doc will help you to understand the configuration.***

defaultContentLanguage = "en" // English i18n
```

View the i18n folder for more details.

Every string(item) in **[]** will be wrapped in `<p></p>` tag in html.

Also, support html tag in string.

## OK, Write a article for your blog.

```

**I recommend you go to [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to select your article cover image.(Small size 640 x 426)**

When your finish your article, remove `draft: true` and run `hugo` to publish your site.

If your want to have a preview in editing, run:

```
